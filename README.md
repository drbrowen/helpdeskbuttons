# helpdeskbuttons
Hardware interface to some buttons using the raw hid library.  Without the custom hardware, this is useless.

This code is used to interface with some custom-built HID hardware to create a stat counter for the iSchool Help Desk.  If you do not have the hardware, this probably won't help much.
